# Roll the dice mini-game !

**I created this dice mini-game to test my skills with JavaScript.**

You can test and play the game here : https://endearing-fairy-62e1b6.netlify.app/

Here are the rules of the game :

**This game is quite simple : the first player to reach 100 points wins !
To earn points, you have to roll the dice, and your current score will be updated with the result of the roll. You just have to click on the "Hold" button to save your score and pass the turn to the other player. But it's not as easy as it looks : if the dice roll is a 1, your current score will be erased and your turn will be over.
Be cautious or take risks to win, the choice is yours!**
